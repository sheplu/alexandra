**Alexandra** is a creative workspace dedicated to crafting and refining **Claude agent profiles** — lovingly called *the Claudettes*.

Each file in this repository describes how an agent should think, behave, and collaborate.
It’s where personalities are shaped, tones are tuned, and prompts find their rhythm.

## 🧠 Overview

At this stage, **Alexandra** serves as a **design studio for agents**:

- Each **Markdown file** defines one agent’s role, purpose, and working style
- Content may include **sample prompts, constraints, tools**, or **expected outputs**
- The goal is to iterate, test, and refine the design of every agent before integration

Think of it as **pre-production** — the rehearsal room before the Claudettes step on stage. 🎶

│   ├── chantal.md  → Code Review agent
│   ├── sophie.md    → Creative Writing agent
│   └── nadine.md    → DevOps & Automation agent
└── README.md

Each agent file contains:

- **Overview** – Purpose and scope
- **Core traits** – Tone, personality, decision-making style
- **Prompt design** – System and example instructions
- **Interaction notes** – When and how to use the agent

## 💃 The Claudettes

| Agent | Role | Personality |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Marie** | Research & Analysis | Curious, detail-oriented |
| **Chantal** | Code Reviewer | Strict but fair |
| **Sophie** | Creative Writer | Imaginative, poetic |
| **Nadine** | DevOps Engineer | Pragmatic, efficient |

Each Claudette has her own Markdown file — her character sheet, if you will.
*(All of them report to Alexandra, of course.)*

## 🎶 Inspiration

The name **Alexandra** comes from the iconic **Claude François** song *“Alexandrie Alexandra”* -
because managing a troupe of Claudettes deserves a touch of disco flair. 🪩
